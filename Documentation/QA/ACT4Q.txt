•	How do you prevent XSS is this step when displaying the username of the user who uploaded the video?
Flask configures Jinja2 to automatically escape all values unless explicitly told otherwise. This should rule out all XSS problems caused in templates.
Ideally, we can implement a Content-Security-Policy that will require all resources to be loaded over HTTPS, allow only <script> elements with the correct nonce attribute, and prevent loading any plugins.


•	How do you ensure that users can’t delete videos that aren’t their own?
In the database we attache the video with the user id and check if the video is actullay belongs to the user who tries to delete it, if the user own the video then he can delete it, however, if the user is no the owner of the video then a warning pops up and the video does not get deleted.
