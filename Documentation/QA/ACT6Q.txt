•	How would you fix your code so that this issue is no longer present?
     2 Possible fixes for this issue are as follows:
       1.) We could add in a whitelist of file names that are not allowed to be uploaded if a user was to pass in a URL to them.
       2. ) We could add in a check that doesn't allow files from an internal IP to be uploaded. Instead the file retrieved from the URL must be from an external source.


•	How does your test demonstrate SSRF as opposed to just accessing any old endpoint
       We know this test is SSRF because when the URL gets submitted the request is put directly into our webserver rather than through some other endpoint.
