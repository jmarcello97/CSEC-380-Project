â€¢	How would you fix your code so that this issue is no longer present?
In order to resolve this issues, passing an arugment dirctely from the end user to the os (eg. os.system) in the system library is critical and would cause such attack. So an  input sanatization (check for &&) before supplying that to the os is mandatory and will help fix the issue. Also, instead of using os.system, we could use os.remove which would onlu allow us to delete one file at a time.
